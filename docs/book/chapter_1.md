## Key Ideas
1. rust like shell scripting lagnuage.
2. light weight.
3. low memory cost.
4. strongly typed.
5. portable.

## Backends
As a part of the ecosystem axolotl will lend itself to having its abstract syntax tree distributed, and be well documented. With vale as inspiration, this feature of the ecosystem will be designed so that individuals can implement a complient backend. The default supported backends will be the interpreter, and the LLVM backend, but other platforms, such JVM, and .NET runtime.

## Baremetal support
Axolotl is designed to define a minimal set of requirements needed to for the rest of its functionality, making it easy to port to new platforms.
