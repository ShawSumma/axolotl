# Rust Style Result Types

rust returns [Options](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html), and [Result](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/) enums that indicate Success or failure. By returning from functions, while wrapping return values, the programmer invoking a function must handle the result. but as a result there tends to be a fair bit of boiler plate code in order to create error types. This usually requires either using the [err-derive crate](https://crates.io/crates/err-derive) or manually implementing [std::fmt::Display](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html), both require work to implement, as well as work to properly  destruction these erroneous states While Often also requiring re-execution if an erroneous state is returned from several functions.
